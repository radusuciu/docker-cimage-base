[CIMAGE](https://github.com/wangchulab/CIMAGE) is a tool for quantification of mass spectrometry data from activity-based protein profiling experiments. See this paper describing the most recent version: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00455.

This project exists to build a docker image that contains CIMAGE dependencies. I use this image to run various versions of CIMAGE and I do not guarantee that it will work with the latest version. It does not itself contain any CIMAGE code.
